My Atari 8-Bit projects.

This is a repository for my Atari 8-Bit code projects. Most of them require a FujiNet (the N: device) and/or an Atari 1020 printer, because that's what I have.

Everything is coded in FastBasic 4.6.

What's in here so far ...

* Wethern.FB - FujiNet based weather app. Also requires a companion Python script I have running on a Raspberry Pi. You will have to change a local URL in the code. Uses ALLCLTH.DAT and HEADER.DAT image files; put them at the root of your drive.
* Quote.FB - FujiNet based app to download and display inspirational quotes.
* Printh.FB and Banner.FB - Prints a range of Hershey fonts on the 1020 in different sizes. There's some extra work required here.
  - I'm using MyDos 4.5. I create subdirectories called JHA and IDX. Put the JHA files into the JHA subdirectory, and the IDX files into the IDX subdirectory.
